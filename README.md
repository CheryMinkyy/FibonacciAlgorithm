# Fibonacci Sequence Project

This is a Python project that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a number provided by the user.

## Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence goes like this:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34...

In this project, the user is prompted to enter a limit, and the program calculates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to (but not exceeding) that limit.

## How to Use

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fibonacci-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd fibonacci-project
    ```

3. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python fibonacci.py
    ```

4. The program will ask for a number as the upper limit for the Fibonacci sequence. Input a positive integer, and the Fibonacci sequence will be generated up to that limit.

## Example

For example, if you input `100`, the output will be:
[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]
